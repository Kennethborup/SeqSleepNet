## Description

<img src="figures/method.jpg"  width="600">

In this study we present a number of important contributions to the field of automatic sleep scoring:
- To our knowledge, this is the first study successfully leveraging unlabeled, personal data, which is likely to be important in long term sleep monitoring.
- We show that simple ensembles of 10 SeqSleepNet models trained independently improve predictive performance, and only differ by 0.04 in Cohenâ€™s kappa compared to the best case scenario of two manual scorers.
- Despite no change in model architecture, we show that a single SeqSleepNet model trained with our semi-supervised distillation setup retains between 50% and 100% of the improvements obtained by ensemble models (of various size) when trained with personal data.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The required dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install the minimal dependencies, create a conda environment and install the dependencies:
```{bash}
conda env create --file environment.yml
```
For full environment use `environment_full.yml` instead.

### Executing program

A multitude of options are available for training and evaluating the models. The main script is `selftrain.py` and the options are available by running:
```{bash}
python selftrain.py --help  
```
An example of training a model with semi-supervised distillation on 5 first subjects is:
```{bash}
python selftrain.py \
    --seed 0 \
    --deterministic \
    --gpus 1 \
    --max_epochs 1500 \
    --learning_rate 1e-4 \
    --weight_decay 1e-3 \
    --early_stopping_delay 700 \
    --normalize \
    --cv_weights_folders <insert path to teacher weights> \
    --ensemble_pseudo_labels \
    --only_test_pseudo_subjects \
    --cv_range 5 \
```

Models can be evaluated using the `evaluate.py` script.
